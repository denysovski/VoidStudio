# Project Overview
This repository contains the front-end development of a concept website for an art direction studio. The project emphasizes a design-led engineering approach, translating visual identity and narrative into a structured, maintainable front-end implementation.
The website is built with a focus on clarity, performance, and visual restraint, prioritizing typography, layout systems, and interaction hierarchy over unnecessary complexity. Development is carried out in Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot to accelerate iteration while preserving deliberate human design decisions.

## Key Objectives
- Implement a visually driven website aligned with contemporary art direction standards
- Maintain clean, readable, and scalable front-end architecture
- Balance creative experimentation with technical discipline
- Use Copilot as an assistive tool, not an automated replacement for design intent

## Technical Stack
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Styling: Custom CSS (monochrome, grid-based layout, typographic focus)
- Tooling: Visual Studio Code, GitHub Copilot
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Design & Development Principles
- Design-first development: Visual identity informs structure and interaction
- Minimalism: Reduced UI elements to enhance content and atmosphere
- Consistency: Reusable components and predictable layout patterns
- Maintainability: Clear naming conventions and modular code organization

## Project Scope
- Static front-end website
- No backend or database integration
- Optimized for modern browsers
- Intended for creative studios, portfolios, or experimental brand platforms

## Status
Active development / experimental concept
